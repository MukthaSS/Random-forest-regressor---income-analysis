# Random-forest-regressor - income-analysis
### About the model  : 
Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning family. It is primarily used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous output (as opposed to classification tasks where the goal is to predict discrete labels). It builds multiple decision trees and combines their results to make a more accurate and robust prediction.

##### Pickle:
This part of the code saves a trained machine learning model to a file so that you can use it later without needing to retrain it.
Explanation:
pickle: A Python library used to save (serialize) and load (deserialize) objects.
model: This is the trained machine learning model that you want to save.
filename: The name of the file where the model will be saved (SuperMarket Analysis.pkl).
pkl.dump(): This function saves the model to a file in binary format (wb stands for "write binary").
